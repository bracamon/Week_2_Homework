# BootCamp Homework Assignment 01
## Code Refactor for Horiseon

#### Objective
The goal of this exercise is to refactor existing code such that it meets the following critera set forth by the client:

  GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
  WHEN I view the source code
  THEN I find semantic HTML elements
  WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
  THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
  WHEN I view the image elements
  THEN I find accessible alt attributes
  WHEN I view the heading attributes
  THEN they fall in sequential order
  WHEN I view the title element
  THEN I find a concise, descriptive title


The HTML and CSS files reflect updates that include the following:

  * Alt and title text for all images and icons for the purpose of complying with accessibility and search engine optimization standards.

  * Removal of redundant code so that CSS reads more efficiently.

  * Reorganization of CSS such that it mirrors structure of the HTML code.

  * Utilization of the default browser to ensure that the visual representation of the updated HTML and CSS files conincides with the source code output.
